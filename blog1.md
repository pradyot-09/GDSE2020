# Nearshoring? I thought it was called offshoring?
## Nearshoring in the context of GDSE: Part 1

Hi folks! We are a group of 4 students currently doing our masters in Computer Science at TU Delft. As a part of our contribution to the Body of Knowledge of Globally Distributed Software Engineering, we've come up with a three series blog on the topic of success and failure factors for offshoring and nearshoring. We will be addressing this topic in the context of Globally Distributed Software Engineering. As we progress through the blogs, we'll address the contrast between nearshoring and offshoring, the success and failure factors, a case study, and the future scope but with overall more focus on nearshoring. But first let's understand what nearshoring and offshoring really is.

We can say that outsourcing has given birth to Globally Distributed Software Engineering  (GDSE). Outsourcing can be formally defined as engaging with third-party vendors on a contract basis to deliver a specific deliverable. In the context of software engineering, outsourcing involves the transfer of software development activities of an IT firm. The aim is to focus on business value, scale up software development and reduction in services supplied internally within the company. 

Outsourcing is usually operated with the aim of gaining cost benefits. Especially development and fixed costs can be reduced significantly. For example, if a company is more focused on business matters and strengthening its creativity, outsourcing software development to a company who specialises in this sector could allow the business to minimise additional costs and improve quality. As a consequence, the company can improve its market position, on both strategic and functional levels.

Nearshoring is outsourcing software development to vendors/companies in nearby countries with respect to the home country of the firm. This is often (but not necessarily) a country sharing border with the home country, which can be regarded as the opposite of farshoring.

Offshoring refers to the practice of contracting work to a vendor in a different country. Normally, it refers to a significant distance (across ocean) away from home country of organization. In this series of blog posts, we use the terms "offshoring" and "farshoring" in an exchangeable manner.

### Why nearshoring?
Now that we have an understanding of what nearshoring is, we can ask ourselves why a company would want to outsource work with the use of nearshoring. There are some general advantages to outsourcing work, for example that you do not have the expertise needed for certain parts of the work, but the expertise is available somewhere else in the world, or in order to save money on wages. Of course these advantages apply to nearshoring, but they are not specifically advantages for nearshoring. A good way to look at some benefits or advantages of nearshoring is to compare nearshoring with offshoring and see for different aspects if one might be better than the other.
 
### Nearshoring vs offshoring
One of the big advantages that nearshoring has over offshoring is the fact that it is geographically closer to the company. This leads to several factors, like less cultural differences, more similar time zones and easier opportunities for face-to-face communication, which in turn leads to benefits regarding communication and team cooperation. Time zones and face-to-face meetings will be discussed in the second blogpost of our series, while later on in this post, we will go into more detail on the cultural differences within nearshoring. 
However, looking back at the comparison between nearshoring and offshoring, it is important to stress that looking for an outsourcing vendor that is geographically close to your homebase is not the only thing that should be considered when you want to outsource work. One of the main reasons companies often choose to do outsourcing, is that they believe it will save them money. One way to save money is to outsource the work to a lower wage country. If we in this case compare offshoring countries, like India or China, with nearshore countries, like eastern European countries, the amount of money you save on wages when offshoring is greater compared to nearshoring[1].
Furthermore, wages are not the only costs a company has. As our second post will discuss, there are also some “hidden costs” related to outsourcing your work, ranging from paying for the actual search of a suitable outsourcing vendor to the cost of transitioning business processes to and from that vendor.
There are also cases that a product takes longer to build than intended, or work needs to be redone, leading to extra working hours, etc. The key factors in most of these situations that can turn into costs for the company is the lack of proper infrastructure and communication, between the off- or nearshore locations and the company’s “homebase”.
Whether it is better for a company to choose offshoring or nearshoring really differs per company, because every company has its own interests. In order for a company to find out what fits best for them, they would need to do research themselves in order to find out what fits their interests the best.
 
### Cultural difference
We have mentioned the importance of cost and communication when it comes to outsourcing work, but another very important factor when outsourcing is the cultural difference. Most people will know that there is a big difference in culture when it comes to western countries, like the United States or Germany, and Asian countries, like India and China, but how does this transfer to nearshoring? Is there still a cultural difference even in countries that are really close to one another?
Generally speaking there is a smaller cultural difference when it comes to nearshoring, however even in nearshoring there are still cultural differences that need to be taken into account. A nice example of such a difference is given in the book ‘The Software Industry: Economic principles, strategies, perspectives.’[2]. In the book they give an example of the different interpretation of actions between someone from the Netherlands and someone from Germany. In general people in the Netherlands are not as formal as people from Germany and  for the Dutch people, verbal agreements can be just as binding as written agreements. Thus in the case of a German asking a Dutch counterpart to turn a verbal agreement into a written agreement, the Dutch counterpart might take this as a lack of trust, which could damage the relationship between them. This is not the only encounter of a different perception of formalization, as in another paper[3] this difference is also brought to light. In this case the work was outsourced from Germany to countries such as Serbia and Tunisia. In the paper they have some quotes of representatives of the teams located in these countries, in which is stated that as they are from different cultures, they have different perspectives on matters. 
Even though the cultural differences exist between neighbouring countries, the difference is much smaller when comparing nearshoring to offshoring, and through minimizing the barriers, the cooperation within a distributed team can increase. Furthermore, this leads to fewer misunderstandings within the team which in turn reduces the amount of rework needing to be done. Studies have shown that these are factors that lead to an increased level of trust between the team members[4].

### Recap (Boil Down?)
After reading this post you hopefully have a more clear understanding of what nearshoring and offshoring mean, along with some of the benefits they bring, like saving costs on wages and giving access to new talent. Furthermore, we have seen that while cultural differences are still present when using nearshoring, they are not by far as big as when doing offshoring, and how this brings with it some positive effects.
But what are some of the key factors that can make nearshoring work? And what are key factors that can make nearshoring fail? Are there any examples of companies successfully implementing nearshoring? If you want to find out more about the answers to these questions, make sure to read our second post in our blog series!
